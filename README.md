## Spotify Revamp

This was one the first project that got me into programming, so I thought how cool would it be to rebuild it again with the new knowledge that I gained!

## Tech Stack

### Front-End

- React (I'm most familar with it so it allows me to iterate fast)
- Vite (I liked the speed of it and it compiles my project so much faster)

### Back-End

- Python (Super familar with it so I can iterate fast)
- FastAPI (I liked the documentation generation functionality of it)

### Database

- DynamoDB (but honestly anything NoSQL will work)

### Deployment

- Netlify (super easy and allows me to deploy in minutes)
